🔎 What is Data Cleaning?

Data Cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.

⚙️ Steps in Data Cleaning:

1. Handling Missing Values:

Drop rows/columns with too many missing values.

2. Fixing Data Types:

Convert string numbers to integers/floats.

Convert date strings to datetime format.



3. Removing Duplicates:

Drop duplicate rows if they exist.


📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Theory
